# api-docs

### nasa/api-docs repository contains the front-end for http://api.nasa.gov/. This site is currently CNAME mapped to NASA domain, but in the event the page is down, you can access it through Github Pages here: http://nasa.github.io/api-docs/ .

The current iteration of api.nasa.gov lives in the **gh-pages** branch.

This project contains API listings of available NASA public APIs and well as a GSA API key form to allow NASA branded API pages to be integrated with the GSA api.data.gov system. Our listing is currently **incomplete** as we are currently displaying the more simple API's in our .json storage system.

For other US government agency API pages, see <a href="https://api.data.gov/">https://api.data.gov/</a>

## NOTICE: NASA does not host/develop these APIs
We only map the orginal developer's endpoint to one of our api.nasa.gov endpoints. Basically, api.nasa.gov acts as a passthrough service. Please do not contact us with technical questions about a particular API as <b> we do not have access to most API production environments</b>. You can follow links on our site to get more information about each API and use the contact information on those pages to reach the people who control each API.

### If you are a NASA civil servant or contractor and wish to add an API to api.nasa.gov, please contact <a href="mailto.nasa-data@lists.arc.nasa.gov">nasa-data@lists.arc.nasa.gov</a>.
