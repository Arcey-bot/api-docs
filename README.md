# api-docs

nasa/api-docs repository contains the front-end for http://nasa.github.io/api-docs/.  This site will be CNAME mapped to 
api.nasa.gov

This project will contain API developer pages for available NASA public APIs and will additionally house web components to allow
NASA branded API pages to be integrated with the GSA api.data.gov system.  

## Important: NASA does not host/develop these APIs
We only map the orginal developer's endpoint to one of our api.nasa.gov endpoints. Please do not contact us with technical questions about a particular API as we generally do not have access to the production environment.
