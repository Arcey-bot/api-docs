# api-docs

nasa/api-docs repository contains the front-end for http://nasa.github.io/api-docs/.  This site will be CNAME mapped to 
api.nasa.gov. 

The code live on api.nasa.gov is from the gh-pages branch, not master branch.

This project will contain API developer pages for available NASA public APIs and will additionally house web components to allow NASA branded API pages to be integrated with the GSA api.data.gov system. For other US government agency API pages, see <a href="https://api.data.gov/">https://api.data.gov/</a>

## Important: NASA does not host/develop these APIs
We only map the orginal developer's endpoint to one of our api.nasa.gov endpoints. Basically, api.nasa.gov acts as a passthrough service. Please do not contact us with technical questions about a particular API as <b>we generally do not have access to the API production environments</b>. You can typically follow links on api.nasa.gov to more information about each API and then find contact information on those pages to people who control each API.

If you are a NASA civil servant or contractor and will to add an API to api.nasa.gov, please contact nasa-data@lists.arc.nasa.gov.
